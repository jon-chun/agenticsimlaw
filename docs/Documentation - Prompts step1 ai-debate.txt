<INSTRUCTIONS>
Please closely analyze this <CODE_ABBREVIATED> to throughly understand how it works as well as deeply critique it to identify the sources of the following errors:

1. The output files under ../transcripts/{model_name} always print blanks after "PREVIOUS ARGUMENTS" generated by line "PREVIOUS DEBATE HISTORY: {chr(10).join(self.debate_history)}"

2. When the last judge API call to get the final decision times out with:

2025-01-20 12:14:18,464 | WARNING | Timeout for agent Judge
2025-01-20 12:14:18,465 | DEBUG | judge_response=None
2025-01-20 12:14:18,465 | DEBUG | Judge response is None -> final_ruling stays 'No decision'.

2.a. The /transcript output file *.txt incorrectly outputs "correctness: True" when it should pass through the API response "No decision"

2.b. The /transcript output file *.json incorrectly outputs '"prediction_accurate": "True"' when it should pass through the API response "No decision" 

3. If the ollama API model is not installed, the program should just skip it with an error message f"ERROR: Skipping model: {model_name} which is either mispelled or needs to be installed via ollama" instead of creating a bunch of empty files under ../transcripts/{model_name}

4. The program should be restartable in the sense that when looping over a model for the first time
4.a. first calculates the total number of the max_number of output files that should exist in the output subdir ../transcripts/{model_name} as max_output_model_files_ct = CASE_CT * REPEAT_CT * 2 # 2 = *.json + *.txt file for each simluation
4.b. second calculates the current number of output simlulation files as cur_output_model_files_ct = total count(*.json and *.txt files in the output model subdir) NOTE: (if odd, then first delete any unpaired *.txt or *.json file)
4.c. third calculates the remaining_simluation_ct = (max_output_model_file_ct - cur_output_model_file_ct)/2  
4.d. temporarily (for the current model we're using) modify the loop over REPEAT_CT to use reamining_simluations_ct instead (restore it to REPEAT_CT for the next model iteration if the output subdir is empty or does not exist) (LINE: "for attempt_i in range(REPEAT_CT):")

Think carefully to identify all the lines of code that need modifcation and print out the complete functions/objects of only those that need to be updated.
